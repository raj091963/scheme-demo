                <h3>Housing Facility</h3>
The National Scheme of Welfare of Fishermen offers fishermen facilities for constructing houses. There is no upper limit for building homes in a particular village as it entirely depends on the number of fishermen residing. States through this scheme ensure equal distribution of houses among all fishermen. Also, this government-backed scheme dictates the house construction with a base area within 35 sq. mt. Also, the cost must not exceed ₹75,000.


                <h3>Construction of Common Facility</h3>
This government-backed scheme ensures building a community hall in some instances if there are more than 75 houses in a village. This scheme will build a community hall (with two toilets and a tube well) with a base area measuring 200 sq. mt. and within ₹2 lakh.  Fishermen can use this community hall as a mending shed and a drying yard.


                <h3>Assurance of Clean Drinking Water</h3>
This scheme offers a tube well for every 20 houses. Also, depending on the requirement, the number of tube wells is increased. In addition, this scheme provides an alternative option where tubewell installation is not possible.
